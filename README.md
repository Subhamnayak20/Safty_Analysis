I have practices data analysis on the safty dataset using excel and powerbi
# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes workplace safety and employee health data to understand worker conditions, absenteeism, injury patterns, and insurance eligibility. The analysis helps derive actionable insights for HR and safety management, such as identifying high-risk employees, long-term absenteeism, and compensation eligibility.

The project demonstrates data analysis, logical reasoning, and visualization skills using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

# Dataset Structure
## 🟢 Sheet 1 – Main Data

1. Contains the raw workforce safety dataset
2. Includes details such as:
3. Worker ID / Employee details
4. Shift information
5. Injury status and injury count
6. Days absent
7. Age and age group
8. Salary-related fields
Other safety and attendance-related attributes

This sheet acts as the primary source of truth and is not heavily modified

## 🟡 STAT (Sheet 2) – Analysis & Business Logic

This sheet contains the core analysis and business rule implementation, derived from Sheet 1.
- Excel Functions & Logic Used:
  - SUM / AVERAGE – salary totals, absence averages
  - COUNT / COUNTIFS – injured workers, absentee counts
  - IF / IFS – insurance eligibility logic
  - VLOOKUP / HLOOKUP – referencing worker details
  - Logical & conditional formulas to:
  - Identify workers eligible for insurance
  - Calculate total salary payout
  - Detect long-term absenteeism
  - Group workers by age categories
  - Highlight workers with high injury risk
This sheet represents the decision-making layer of the project.

## 📊 Analysis Performed
Identification of insurance-eligible workers based on safety and attendance criteria
- Calculation of total salary payouts for eligible employees
- Analysis of long-term absentee workers
- Injury trends across different shifts
- Age-group-based analysis of injuries and absenteeism
- Detection of high-risk worker profiles

📈 Data Visualization
